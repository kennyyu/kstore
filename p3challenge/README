HOW TO RUN THE CHALLENGE:
========================
To run the test, first start the server:

    ./server

Next, start the client and load the data, providing the appropriate
path to the csv files as part of the "--loaddir" command line
option:

    ./client --loaddir /path/to/p3challenge/csvs < load.txt

Next, actually perform the query:

    ./client < p3challenge.txt

NOTE:
====
The column names of t.csv must be "ta,tb,tc,td", NOT "a,b,c,d".
Similarly, the column names of u.csv must be "ua,ub,uc,ud", NOT "a,b,c,d".
